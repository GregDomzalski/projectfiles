# projectfiles - dotfiles for starting my projects

A set of default "dotfiles" such as `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, etc. that I pull from to bootstrap new
projects. This project will stay up to date with my latest "best practices" for various languages and
platforms that I regularly use.

The files may include more than what I would normally put in a project. For example, my `.gitignore` may
include ignores for both .NET and PHP/Laravel at the same time even though I probably would not have a
project that mixes those two platforms. I would pull out the relevant sections and trim down the files.

This project may evolve into a more generic set of templates as well. We'll see!
